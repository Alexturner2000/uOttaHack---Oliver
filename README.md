# Oliver - Your Personal Wellbeing Assistant
[App for uOttaHack 2021](https://devpost.com/software/oliver?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects&fbclid=IwAR0GWO3bOMQzyooOjTQ_YTcFS6j6QH5EJZf9KRccyoPLdfZc7ciqTLZBnR8)

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from our personal situations at home, that is, the fact that we are now always at home. We came to realize that since we spend all day at home as students with remote learning, it has become more difficult to hold our regular routines, and as such we find ourselves taking care of our physical and mental wellbeing a lot less. In addition to that, we have seen our productivity plummet outside of a dedicated learning environment, making online school all the more difficult. As such, we decided to make an application that remote students or workers like us (or anybody else for that matter) could use to help them stay on track of their personal wellbeing and productivity.

# What it does
Our application promotes physical and mental wellbeing, as well as productivity, by giving the user new challenges every day (that relate to the user) to encourage them to take care of what needs to be cared for. Every day, the user receives several challenges in each category (physical wellbeing, mental wellbeing, and productivity), and each challenge carries a certain number of points that will be rewarded to the user upon the completion of said challenge. These points serve to fill each category's point bar (much like an experience bar in many video games), which then serves to level up the user. This gamification of daily tasks is how we hope to keep the user engaged, and just in case our users forget about our daily challenges, we send gentle (and perhaps lightly annoying) reminders in the form of notifications to keep the user focused and engaged. At the end of the day, we serve to help them.

# How we built it
We build this application on the Android platform using Android studio since it was a technology none of us had really ever used before, making the experience an incredibly interesting challenge. Android studio uses Java or Kotlin, and we chose Java. We also used Google's Firebase for our authentication and database (all in the cloud).

# Challenges we ran into
Many challenges arose, mostly stemming from our lack of experience with the platform. Some of the biggest included database integration (firebase's real-time database turned out to be not as beginner-friendly as we had hoped), and designing the actual application (android studio's built-in XML visualizer is great but not nearly as intuitive as web programming, for instance).

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our proudest accomplishment would have to be the integration between the authentication and the database through Firebase. While they do have a lot of built-in features to make android development easier, connecting those together and ensuring user data continuously gets stored and updated session after session was extremely gratifying once we finally got it to work.

# What we learned
Aside from the obvious learning about Java and android development, we learned quite a bit about cloud authentication and databases, and perhaps most importantly, the importance of quality version control. Git is a national treasure and learning how to use it most efficiently may have been the greatest lesson out of this entire experience for us.

# What's next for Oliver - Your Personal Wellbeing Coach
Since we are a group of friends who enjoy coding in their spare time, the plan is to polish Ollie up and put him on the Google play store. We will, of course, continue using it on our own, but we want to make sure our friends and everyone else in the world who could benefit can have access as well :)
